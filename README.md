# Access Checker

Page scraper frontend for [access-sniff](https://www.npmjs.com/package/access-sniff) / [HTML_CodeSniffer]() generated reports.


### TODO


- [  ] improve styling
- [  ] make the form part of the angular app
- [  ] add sorting and search functions to the list of issues
- [  ] add functionality to name and sort the reports better ("home.json" wtf?)
- [  ] maybe move this whole operation to a browserSync plugin?
